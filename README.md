# Minimal Python template
A minimal Python library cookiecutter template.

There are many great Python cookiecutter templates, such as one by [Jace Browning](https://github.com/jacebrowning/template-python/tree/main) or one by [Netherlands eScience Center template](https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template). The idea of the one in this repository is to provide a strongly reduced template for simpler repositories or beginners.


## How to use this

You need `cookiecutter` installed (e.g. using pip). Then you can create a new repository by running:
```
cookiecutter https://github.com/florian-huber/minimal-python-template.git
```
